\begin{abstract}
We propose a lightweight program synthesizer that generates HTML from static Wireframe design graph.
With our program, a UI/UX designer with little or no programming experience can obtain responsive HTML from design layout.

\section{Introduction}
Program synthesis community targets mainly on string processing and integer manipulating problem. However, the need for generating web application and other Graphical User Interface(GUI) applications is growing. While some UI/UX designers are capable of writing frontend code, providing them with a tool that generating HTML code can be beneficial. With HTML code equivalent to their interface design, designers can edit, test, and improve the original static layout. For example, many web applications now seek compatibility between PC and mobile devices. The different sizes complicate the designers' work. Some layouts are more promising on $16:9$ screen than on other smart devices. With the responsive HTML generated by our project, designer can preview the layout in a new resolution without re-drawing.

Our work focuses on configure the relationship between each atom elements in the static layout. We combine components of different sizes and locations into horizontal/vertical divisions and grids.  Instead of the absolute coordinate given by input, we assign margin to the converted structure and remember the relative position between them. Without the limitation of absolute coordinates, the converted structures can be rendered with the designers' true intention.

We define our workflow as a two-staged program. In the first stage, we synthesize the input Wireframe rectangles to IR. Then IR is compiled into universal HTML compatible with any browser in the second stage. 


\subsection{IR Definition}

\section{Algorithm}
% Shangyin
In this section, we explain the procedures we used synthesizing the list of rectangles to IR with an estimate order of time complexity. We also present the compilation process from IR to final HTML result.
\subsection{IR Synthesis}
Recall that the input is a list of rectangles. This is the starting point of the synthesis, and we target the nested hierarchical IR. 
\subsubsection{Cut}


\subsubsection{Input}
RECT\\
RECTLIST:= RECTLIST RECT | Nil
\subsubsection{IR}
DIV\\
HDIV:= HDIV|DIV|VDIV\\
VDIV:= HDIV|DIV|VDIV\\
First we divide the rectangles into section based on their $y$-axis. Then we use
greedy to find the earliest possible cut $y$ such that this $y$ does not divide any
other rects.
